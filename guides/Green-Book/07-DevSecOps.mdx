# 7.0 DevSecOps

DevSecOps means adding security perspective as natural part to DevOps processes from the start. In DevSecOps security planning and development are joined to everyday tasks. 

DevSecOps also benefits from automation. To get the most out of DevSecOps is important at the beginning of the project to make risk and benefit analysis, security, and vulnerability analysis so, it is possible to set target frames for the project. Good planning at the start of the project also helps implementing as many as possible DevSecOps tools to the project processes. 

During the development it is important to monitor the fulfillment of the set safety objectives. All set safety objectives should be met before the project is finished and the service is ready to be delivered.
GitLab offers many tools that can be used to bring DevSecOps to the projects.
