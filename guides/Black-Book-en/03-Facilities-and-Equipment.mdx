# 3.0 Facilities and Equipment
In the summer of 2018, two classrooms were reserved for WIMMA Lab's premises at the JAMK University of Applied Sciences, where the movable wall between them was removed. The most optimal situation for WIMMA Lab is that all participants in the project can be seated in the same room. The coach should also fit into the same space so that they can be actively involved in WIMMA Lab's day to day work.

The facilities and equipment to be used should be sorted out as soon as possible, as it is important to start working immediately when WIMMA Lab starts.

Each participant should be booked at least:
* One large desk
* An office chair that can seat 8 hours a day (note ergonomics!)
* A powerful enough computer to do the job
* Mouse and Mousepad
* Keyboard
* Display (two displays per person recommended)

Table positions should also take into account the needs of the network implementation, such as the location of the network plugs and the adequacy of the power lines. Every machine should have a well-functioning Internet connection. From the perspective of usability of the premises, it's advisable to bring enough coat racks and trash cans to critical locations. For potential guests, it's good to have extra chairs available.

The requirements of the assignments should be kept in mind when designing the premises. For example, if there's a lot of hardware used, equipment may not fit into the workstations of the participants, so it's good to reserve extra tables for some of the virtual companies. For design work, it would be a good idea to have mobile flip charts available.

The formation of open office space should be avoided due to noise. To reduce noise, movable partitions can be placed in the room at suitable locations. They also create visual protection and allow teams to create their own work areas.

It's worth investing in the comfort of the premises, for example in the form of artificial plants. Team members can be advised to bring their own coffee cups and posters for the duration of the project to make their workspace look like their own. Team members should also bring their own headphones, as they help to focus on personal work in peace without distractions.

It's worthwhile to take into account the amount of noise caused by people on a break and its impact on the people who work. If it's found to cause too much interference, the break room should be placed outside the workspace. There should also be a place for coffee in the break room.
