# 4.0 Assignments
It is very important for the success of WIMMA Lab to find suitable assignments. Special attention should be paid to the following:
* It is a good idea to assign assignments that relate to each other to the virtual companies to be able to cross resources.
* The assignment must not be too easy, or insurmountable. Too easy or difficult task lowers participants motivations.
* In an optimal case, the assignment has a separate client who directs the work in the right direction and gives feedback. The sponsor should be available during WIMMA Lab. If there is insufficient feedback from the sponsor, the development of the work may possibly continue in the wrong direction.
* The assignment must solve a problem. This creates motivation when not working "for nothing".
* It is also worth considering whether the assignments have a common theme. For example, the theme may come from some trend that is popular right now.
