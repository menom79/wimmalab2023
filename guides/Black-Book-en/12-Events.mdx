# 12.0 Events
WIMMA Lab has a number of different events, such as Kettu Keter and Kaunailta, main purpose of which is to lift the spirit and at the same time to relieve pressure of the participants. It is important to have the participants 'own stuff' that can be discussed in the next few days.

There are also more formal events, such as the Open Doors, which is designed to show participants expertise to third parties and to raise interest for WIMMA Lab. It is essential for the continuation of WIMMA Lab that companies show interest in it, as companies give assignments, guidance and equipment to use during WIMMA Lab.

### 12.1 Open Doors
Open Doors is WIMMA Lab's biggest and most public event, presenting the outputs of virtual companies to external companies and others that are interested. The event aims to gather feedback on the work done and to network with people in their field.

Each virtual company can demo their own products, and members can share their own expertise and role in product implementation.

#### 12.1.1 Ahead of the Open Doors
It is advisable to start the marketing of Open Doors as early as possible in order to attract the attention of the guests. Every available channel should be utilized and messages, videos and pictures should be put on social media several times a week. This keeps Open Doors fresh in their memory and it is not forgotten. It is also a good idea for the instructors to use their own contacts for the benefit of WIMMA Lab and invite guests with personalized, personal messages to visit Open Doors.

Well before Open Doors, one should consider whether Open Doors should be arranged in the workplace itself, or whether it should be in its own space. If dozens of guests are expected, booking your own space is a better option for everyone to get around better. The chairs are also good to book in the room so that guests can sit if they wanted.

If there is a service, for example, coffee and buns, ordering them and planning the service should be done ahead of time. The service should be designed as smoothly as possible so that there is no so-called "Bottlenecks" in front of the table. It is also advisable to take into account any special diets that you might have, such as juice and tea.

It is good to build the demo spaces of virtual companies ahead of time and test that the hardware used works as desired. For each product it would be a good idea to make a newsletter showing the main points of the product. For the participants, it is also advisable to make nameplates that can be attached to the chest, where you can tell your own name and your company name and some keywords, for example.

In the summer of 2018, each virtual company received its own area of responsibility, which they managed to manage themselves:
* Mysticons: organizing a coffee table and distributing coffee during the event.
* Iotitude: Obtaining Demo Hardware for Virtual Companies.
* Overflow: Organizing Network Connections for Demo Points.
* Pengwin Media: Newsletters for businesses, name tags, signboards, marketing.

General leaflets about WIMMA Lab can also be printed to share to the guests, creating a more memorable experience.

In the summer of 2018 WIMMA Lab's Open Doors were held on Wednesday 13.6. It is important to organize the event well in advance before everyone leaves for a summer holiday. It is much more difficult to get people to visit during the summer holiday.

#### 12.1.2 Just Before Open Doors

At this stage, every participant should have an up-to-date LinkedIn account in order to make the networking as smooth as possible.

Signs should be placed in all critical locations to ensure that guests that are arriving have an easier time. You should also consider alternative routes, for example, are the guests going up the elevator or the stairs?

Every participant at WIMMA Lab should know clearly about their own work and the assignment of the virtual company. It also must be taken into account (especially in the IT sector) that not all guests understand the terms in the field.


### 12.1.3 During Open Doors

It is polite to welcome the guests and thank them for participating in the event right from the start. When everyone has got a cup of coffee in their hand and sat down, you can hold a brief presentation and tell the guests about WIMMA Lab.

After the presentation, guests will be able to walk around the virtual companies demo points and to get to know the WIMMA Lab participants and their achievements.

It is also advisable to reserve time for networking so that not all the time is spent on presenting the product. Tasks should be recycled so that everyone has time to talk to people elsewhere than just at their own point.

#### 12.1.4 After Open Doors

When all the guests have left, it's time to relax a little. Open doors is a rather stressful event, as few students are used to socializing so much with unknown people.

It is a good idea to leave the room cleaning for the next day, as everyone is very tired at this point after a long day. After the a bit of relaxing, you can conveniently go to the Ketti Keter.

After Open Doors you can make, for example, a video of the best parts of the event and the good atmosphere. The video is a nice way to thank the guests and to info the people about WIMMA Lab who didn't manage to get to Open Doors. If it is not possible to make a video, photos are a nice memory of the event.

### 12.2 Kettu Keter

The Kettu Keter, in other words Get Together, is after the Open Doors where WIMMA Lab participants and the instructors gather to unload pressure and celebrate getting through Open Doors. At the same time, you can get to know other participants in a more informal environment.

Kettu Keter should have a separate sponsor who will also take part in the event. For example, a sponsor can sponsor food for all participants at a restaurant. Sponsor could be a representative from a company that wants to get to know WIMMA Lab participants in a more relaxed way. It is advisable to agree on the budget well in advance and inform the participants what is being sponsored and what amount.

For the event, it is advisable to reserve enough tables at a suitable restaurant in time to allow everyone to sit close together. It is worthwhile to get to know the menu in advance and, if  possible, the participants orders should be collected beforehand and delivered them to the restaurant. This accelerates the delivery of a large order and makes it easier to the restaurant workers. This will also ensure that the agreed budget is maintained.

When organizing the Kettu Keter, it is worth taking into account that the next mornings work hours might need to be a bit flexible.

### 12.3 Kaunailta
Kaunailta is the closing event for WIMMA Lab, where the participants get to let off steam and to evaluate their work done in the summer.

Like Kettu Keter, Kaunailta also needs a sponsor well ahead of time to sponsor the evening's expenses. The event is supposed to be free-form, and the program can include, for example, sauna and picnic styled eating. All WIMMA Lab participants, instructors and, of course, the sponsor of the event, participate in Kaunailta.

In the summer of 2018, Qvantel sponsored a sauna night in their own represented space. In addition, the participants received pizza and a food drinks per participant.

You should take note that there will probably be more representatives of the company in Kaunailta. Even though the event is free-form, it is good to think what kind of image you want to give to a potential recruiter.

However, the main goal of the evening is to have fun, so that everyone can leave WIMMA Lab behind in a good mood.
