# 7.0 WIMMA Lab Selection Process
The main purpose of the selection process is to get motivated students to WIMMA Lab to the summer who can work in a self-organizing teams. The most optimal situation would be if the applicants had already been in some sort of summer job to get familiar with the practice of working life.

Assignments must be clear ahead of time for the selection process to find the right kind of expertise.

### 7.1 Applying for an Interview
WIMMA Lab is not necessarily accessible to anyone who wants it, because the number of participants should be considered in relation to the size of the premises and the assignments. In the summer of 2018, there were 28 students at WIMMA Lab. The opportunity to apply for WIMMA Lab is good to open as soon as possible and an interview should be organized to gauge the applicants.

It is recommended to interview the applicants either one by one or in pairs. Even two applicants can make the situation more difficult, as the other may be under the guise of another if, for example, a very quiet person is involved. There should be more than one interviewer, so you can compare your opinions after the interview.

The founder of WIMMA Lab, who is responsible for the work at summer, acts as the main interviewer. It is also a good idea for the coach to be involved in the interviews as they will work with selected people every day for the duration of the WIMMA Lab. In addition, you should include technically skilled persons who, if necessary, assist in the identification of the applicant's technical ability.

Particular attention should be paid to interviews, for example. to the following:
* The planned schedule that fits the applicant; 
    - They must not have other overlapping costs that hinder full-time participation. WIMMA Lab's working hours are 8â€“16 on weekdays according to normal working hours.
* Character of the applicant, is the applicant open, who freely talks about things? Or a quieter listener? Happy and brisk?
    - You should try to detect negative attitudes and unwillingness at this stage and eliminate them from the process.
* Motivation, do they have any? 
    - It does not come out so clearly with everyone, even if motivation is found.
* Points of interest that they would particularly like to learn from WIMMA Lab.
    - Requires the applicant to familiarize themselves with the available assignments.
* What do you already know and have experience on?
* Is the applicant willing to act as a team leader? Each team should have a clear leader from the beginning.

It is worth trusting your own impression of a person because it tells a lot. If necessary, a new interview can be arranged later if there is ambiguity in the choices.

### 7.2 Selections of Participants
When all those who are interested are interviewed, you can start thinking about preliminary team divisions. The competencies required for different assignments must be considered in advance to better design team teams. According to the declared competence and interest, the right type of person is selected from the appropriate applicants for suitable virtual companies.

For selected people, you should inform the applicants as soon as possible, for example by e-mail, so that they can plan their schedule accordingly. It is advisable to provide more detailed information on the start of WIMMA Lab and the required operating models. If you have created a site for the duration of the project, it is good to add the address to the message so the selected applicants can view them in advance.

If one of the elected persons is forced to cancel their participation, for example because of access to work, a new person, who has the necessary skills, will be chosen to replace them.

It is also polite for the rest of the applicants to tell them that they weren't selected and to remind them, that there might be some cancellations so you might still be chosen.
